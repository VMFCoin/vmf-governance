# ðŸŽ¨ Dropdown Opacity Fix

## ðŸ“‹ **Issue Summary**

The dropdown component in the submit page was too transparent, causing it to overlap and blend with the background content when opened, making it difficult to read and interact with.

## ðŸ”§ **Changes Made**

### **Enhanced Background Opacity**

- **Before:** `bg-backgroundLight` (semi-transparent)
- **After:** `bg-backgroundDark/95` with gradient overlay (98% opaque)

### **Added Backdrop Blur**

- **New:** `backdrop-blur-sm` with `backdropFilter: 'blur(8px)'`
- **Effect:** Creates a frosted glass effect that separates the dropdown from background content

### **Improved Visual Hierarchy**

- **Background Gradient:**
  ```css
  background: linear-gradient(
    135deg,
    rgba(16, 20, 31, 0.98) 0%,
    rgba(27, 31, 42, 0.95) 100%
  );
  ```
- **Enhanced Shadow:** Upgraded from `shadow-xl` to `shadow-2xl`

### **Better Option Styling**

- **Hover State:** Changed from `hover:bg-backgroundAccent` to `hover:bg-patriotBlue/20`
- **Selected State:** Enhanced with `border-l-4 border-patriotRed` for better visual indication
- **Text Color:** Dynamic color based on selection state:
  - Selected: `text-patriotRed`
  - Unselected: `text-patriotWhite`

## âœ… **Improvements Achieved**

### **Visual Clarity**

- âœ… Dropdown now has 98% opacity instead of being semi-transparent
- âœ… Clear separation from background content
- âœ… Better contrast for text readability

## ðŸŽ¯ **Technical Details**

### **Z-Index Management**

- Maintained `z-50` to ensure dropdown appears above other content
- Added backdrop blur for visual separation

### **Color Scheme Consistency**

- Uses VMF patriotic color palette
- Maintains brand consistency with red accents
- Dark theme optimized

### **Animation & Transitions**

- Smooth `transition-colors duration-150` for hover effects

## ðŸš€ **Result**

The dropdown now provides:
