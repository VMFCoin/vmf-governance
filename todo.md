## üìà Implementation Priority & Success Metrics

### Implementation Schedule:

- **Week 1:** Phase 10.1 (Animation Polish) + Phase 10.2 (Form UX)
- **Week 2:** Phase 10.3 (Mobile) + Phase 11.1 (Component Testing)
- **Week 3:** Phase 11.2 (Integration Testing) + Phase 11.3 (Error Handling)
- **Week 4:** Phase 12.1 (Code Optimization) + Phase 12.2 (Performance Monitoring)

### Success Metrics:

- **Animation Quality:** 60fps animations, <100ms interaction response
- **Test Coverage:** >90% coverage for Phase 9 components
- **Performance:** <3s page load, <100ms voting interactions
- **Mobile Experience:** >95% mobile usability score
- **Error Handling:** <1% error rate in production

### Implementation Notes:

- All phases build upon existing Phase 9 implementations
- Leverage existing animation system in lib/animations.ts
- Follow established testing patterns from Button.test.tsx
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing features
- Focus on production-ready polish and optimization
