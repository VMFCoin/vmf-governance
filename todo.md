# VMF Voice - Dynamic Holiday Charity Proposal System Implementation

---

## ü§ñ AI CONTEXT & PROJECT STATE

### üìä Current Project Status (Updated: January 2025)

**‚úÖ COMPLETED FOUNDATION:** All core infrastructure (Phases 1-8) completed successfully!

**üö® CURRENT ISSUE:** Holiday charity proposals are using hardcoded mock data instead of dynamic holiday-based data

**üéØ IMMEDIATE GOAL:** Replace mock data with dynamic holiday proposal system that:

1. Shows proposals only 2 weeks before military holidays
2. Uses real holiday data from `src/data/holidays.ts`
3. Shows "next holiday" info when no active voting
4. Adapts across all pages (home, proposals, details)

### üèóÔ∏è Current Architecture & Key Files

**Existing Foundation (DO NOT MODIFY):**

- Next.js 14 with App Router + TypeScript ‚úÖ
- TailwindCSS with VMF theme ‚úÖ
- ConnectKit + Wagmi + Viem wallet integration ‚úÖ
- Zustand state management ‚úÖ
- Framer Motion animations ‚úÖ

**Key Files for This Implementation:**

```
üéØ PRIMARY FILES TO MODIFY:
src/data/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ holidays.ts          # ‚úÖ Real holiday data (USE THIS)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ mockData.ts          # ‚ùå Contains mock proposals (REPLACE)

src/components/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ proposals/holiday-charity/HolidayCharityCard.tsx  # Update display logic
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ app/page.tsx         # Home page proposal display
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ app/proposal/[id]/page.tsx  # Detail pages

src/stores/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ useProposalStore.ts  # Proposal state management
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ useHolidayStore.ts   # Holiday data management

üéØ HOLIDAY DATA STRUCTURE (FROM holidays.ts):
- 7 Military holidays with dates, fund allocations, descriptions
- Dynamic date calculation (Memorial Day = last Monday in May)
- Fund amounts: $50K-$200K per holiday
- Calendar event generation with voting periods
```

### üìã CURRENT PROBLEM ANALYSIS

**Issue 1: Mock Data Usage**

- `src/data/mockData.ts` lines 213-240: Hardcoded holiday proposal
- Home page shows this mock proposal regardless of date
- Proposal detail pages use static mock data

**Issue 2: No Date Logic**

- No checking if we're within 2 weeks of a holiday
- No logic to show "next holiday" when voting not active
- No automatic proposal generation based on holiday calendar

**Issue 3: Static Display**

- Holiday charity cards always show same mock content
- No countdown to next holiday
- No adaptive UI based on current date vs holiday schedule

---

## üéØ IMPLEMENTATION PHASES

### üöÄ PHASE 23.1: Dynamic Proposal Generation Logic

**Goal:** Create functions to generate holiday proposals based on current date and holiday schedule

#### üéØ Core Functions Needed:

```typescript
// In src/utils/holidayProposalLogic.ts (NEW FILE)

/**
 * Check if we're within 2 weeks of any holiday (voting period)
 */
export const getActiveHolidayProposal = (): HolidayCharityProposal | null

/**
 * Get the next upcoming holiday when no voting is active
 */
export const getNextUpcomingHoliday = (): { holiday: MilitaryHoliday, daysUntil: number } | null

/**
 * Generate a holiday charity proposal for a specific holiday
 */
export const generateHolidayProposal = (holiday: MilitaryHoliday): HolidayCharityProposal

/**
 * Check if voting should be active for a specific holiday
 */
export const isVotingPeriodActive = (holiday: MilitaryHoliday): boolean

/**
 * Get all holidays that need voting (within 2 weeks)
 */
export const getHolidaysNeedingVoting = (): MilitaryHoliday[]
```

#### üìù Tasks:

- [ ] Create `src/utils/holidayProposalLogic.ts`
- [ ] Implement date calculation logic (2 weeks before holiday)
- [ ] Create holiday proposal generator using real holiday data
- [ ] Add helper functions for voting period detection
- [ ] Test with different dates to ensure correct behavior

**Current Code (Line 129-133):**

```typescript
{mockProposals.slice(0, 3).map(proposal => (
<TypeSpecificProposalCard key={proposal.id} proposal={proposal} />
))}
```

**New Logic Needed:**

```typescript
// Show active holiday proposal if voting period is active
// Otherwise show other proposal types + "next holiday" card
const displayProposals = [
  ...getActiveHolidayProposals(), // 0-1 proposals
  ...otherProposalTypes.slice(0, 2), // Fill remaining slots
];

if (getActiveHolidayProposals().length === 0) {
  // Add "Next Holiday" information card
  displayProposals.push(createNextHolidayCard());
}
```

#### üìù Tasks:

- [ ] **Update proposal fetching logic in `src/app/page.tsx`**

**New Props Structure:**

```typescript
interface HolidayCharityCardProps {
  proposal?: HolidayCharityProposal; // For active voting
  nextHoliday?: {
    // For upcoming holiday
    holiday: MilitaryHoliday;
    daysUntil: number;
  };
  className?: string;
  mode: 'active' | 'upcoming';
}
```

**Display Logic:**

- **Active Mode:** Show voting proposal with charities
- **Upcoming Mode:** Show next holiday countdown and info

#### üìù Tasks:

- [ ] **Update component props and interface**
  - Add support for both active and upcoming modes
  - Update TypeScript interfaces
- [ ] **Create dual display modes**
  - Active: Current voting proposal display

**Total Time for Core Functionality: ~70 minutes**

This will immediately fix the main issue and make the home page show dynamic content based on actual holiday calendar.

---

## üîß AI ASSISTANT GUIDELINES

### üéØ Key Implementation Rules:

1. **USE EXISTING HOLIDAY DATA**: Import from `src/data/holidays.ts`, don't create new holiday data
2. **PRESERVE EXISTING COMPONENTS**: Build upon current components, don't rebuild from scratch
3. **MAINTAIN VMF DESIGN**: Follow existing color scheme and styling patterns
4. **KEEP TYPE SAFETY**: Use existing TypeScript interfaces, extend when needed
5. **TEST DATE LOGIC**: Always consider different date scenarios in implementation

### üìÅ Critical Files Reference:

```
‚úÖ GOOD - USE THESE:
src/data/holidays.ts - Real holiday data with 7 military holidays
src/types/index.ts - Existing TypeScript interfaces
src/components/proposals/holiday-charity/ - Existing components

‚ùå AVOID - DON'T REPLICATE:
Creating new holiday data
Rebuilding existing components from scratch
Breaking existing TypeScript interfaces
Changing the VMF design system
```

### üö® Common Pitfalls to Avoid:

1. **Don't create duplicate holiday data** - Use `holidays.ts`
2. **Don't break existing proposal types** - Only modify holiday charity proposals
3. **Don't ignore date edge cases** - Test year transitions and holiday spacing
4. **Don't overcomplicate** - Simple date math is sufficient
5. **Don't forget TypeScript** - Maintain type safety throughout

---

## üìà SUCCESS METRICS

**Phase 23.1 Success:**

- Functions correctly identify voting periods
- Next holiday calculation works across year boundaries
- Proposal generation uses real holiday data

**Phase 23.2 Success:**

- No more mock holiday proposals in system
- Dynamic proposals integrate with existing state management
- Other proposal types continue working

**Phase 23.3 Success:**

- Home page shows active holiday proposals when relevant
- "Next holiday" card appears when no voting active
- Calendar integration remains functional

**Final Success:**

- System automatically shows holiday proposals 2 weeks before each military holiday
- Users see countdown to next holiday when no voting active
- All pages (home, proposals, details) use dynamic holiday data
- No hardcoded mock holiday proposals remain in codebase

---

## üí° IMPLEMENTATION CONTEXT FOR AI

When working on this project, remember:

- **Foundation is solid** - Don't rebuild, enhance existing system
- **Mock data pattern exists** - Follow existing patterns for other proposal types
- **State management works** - Use existing Zustand stores effectively
- **Components are flexible** - Existing components can be adapted
- **Holiday data is complete** - `holidays.ts` has all needed information

The goal is surgical replacement of mock holiday data with dynamic date-based logic, not a complete rebuild.

## üéØ MILITARY HOLIDAYS REFERENCE (From holidays.ts)

```typescript
7 Military Holidays with Dynamic Dates:
1. Medal of Honor Day - March 25 ($75,000)
2. Memorial Day - Last Monday in May ($150,000)
3. Flag Day - June 14 ($50,000)
4. Independence Day - July 4 ($200,000)
5. Purple Heart Day - August 7 ($75,000)
6. Patriot Day - September 11 ($100,000)
7. Veterans Day - November 11 ($150,000)

Total Annual Fund: $800,000
Voting Period: 2 weeks before each holiday
Calendar Integration: Automatic event generation
```

This reference helps understand the scope and ensures all holidays are properly handled in the dynamic system.

## üé® PHASE 24: CONSOLIDATED FILTER SYSTEM (UI/UX IMPROVEMENT)

### üìä Current Problem: Scattered Filter UI

**Issue:** The vote page currently has 5 separate filter sections scattered across the interface:

1. Proposal Type Filter (4 large cards/tabs)
2. Search Bar (full-width input)
3. Sort Dropdown ("Newest First")
4. Submit Button ("Submit Proposal")
5. Status Filter Tabs (5 tabs: All, Active, Passed, Failed, Pending)

**Goal:** Consolidate all filters into a single, elegant filter panel for better UX and cleaner interface.

---

### üöÄ PHASE 24.1: Create Filter Panel Component

**Goal:** Build a consolidated filter panel component that houses all existing filter logic

#### üéØ Core Component Structure:

```typescript
// src/components/filters/FilterPanel.tsx (NEW FILE)
interface FilterPanelProps {
  isOpen: boolean;
  onClose: () => void;
  // All existing filter props
  searchTerm: string;
  setSearchTerm: (term: string) => void;
  sortBy: SortOption;
  setSortBy: (sort: SortOption) => void;
  filterBy: FilterOption;
  setFilterBy: (filter: FilterOption) => void;
  proposalTypeFilter: ProposalTypeFilter;
  setProposalTypeFilter: (type: ProposalTypeFilter) => void;
  onSubmitProposal: () => void;
  onClearFilters: () => void;
  // Counts for badges
  getStatusCount: (status: FilterOption) => number;
  getProposalTypeCount: (type: ProposalTypeFilter) => number;
}
```

#### üìù Tasks:

- [ ] **Create `src/components/filters/FilterPanel.tsx`**

      <h1>Governance Proposals</h1>
      <p>Participate in VMF governance...</p>
    </div>
    <FilterButton
      activeFilterCount={getActiveFilterCount()}
      onClick={() => setIsFilterPanelOpen(true)}
    />
  </div>
  ```
- [ ] **Add results summary:**
