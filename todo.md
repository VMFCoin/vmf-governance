## üìù Notes for Context Preservation:

- This is a mock/demo version - no real smart contracts yet
- Focus on UX/UI excellence and smooth interactions
- All voting and proposal data should be simulated
- Wallet integration should be functional but use test data
- Prioritize accessibility and responsive design
- Each phase builds upon the previous one
- Maintain clean, scalable code architecture throughout
